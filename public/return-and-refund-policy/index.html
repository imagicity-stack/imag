        <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: October 2025</p>

        <p>
          At IMAGICITY, we believe every collaboration is a partnership built on trust, creativity, and clarity. Each project is
          custom-designed, which means every decision—from initiation to conclusion—runs on mutual understanding and agreement
          between both parties.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>1. Nature of Services</h2>
          <p>
            All IMAGICITY projects are bespoke in nature. We offer marketing, branding, creative, and digital strategy services
            that are fully customized. Once a project is confirmed and initiated, the work involves time, planning, and
            intellectual input from our team. Therefore, refunds are not automatically applicable at any stage.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>2. Mutual Agreement Clause</h2>
          <p>
            All cancellations, returns, or refunds—if any—will be processed solely based on mutual agreement between IMAGICITY and
            the client. Both parties will evaluate the project’s stage, scope of work completed, and associated costs before
            arriving at any resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            IMAGICITY believes in fair and transparent dealings. Any refund, credit note, or adjustment will only be made after
            mutual discussion and written confirmation.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>3. Advance Payment Policy</h2>
          <p>Projects begin only after an agreed advance payment.</p>
          <p>
            This advance secures your project slot and covers the planning and creative setup process. Since the work begins
            immediately after confirmation, the advance is non-refundable, except in cases where IMAGICITY, by mutual agreement,
            decides otherwise.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>4. Cancellation During Project Execution</h2>
          <p>If a project needs to be cancelled after it has started:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The client must send a formal written request explaining the reason for cancellation.</li>
            <li>
              IMAGICITY and the client will mutually review the progress and decide on any refund or adjustment, if applicable.
            </li>
            <li>Source files or project materials will remain with IMAGICITY until all dues are settled.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>5. Post-Delivery Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Once the final deliverables have been submitted or campaigns executed, refunds are not applicable. IMAGICITY may,
            however, offer reasonable post-delivery revisions or support upon discussion.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>6. Digital Purchases</h2>
          <p>For digital assets, templates, or downloadable content sold through our platform, all sales are final and non-refundable.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>7. Non-Response and Project Inactivity</h2>
          <p>
            If a client remains unresponsive or inactive for more than 30 days, IMAGICITY reserves the right to close or archive
            the project. Re-activation, if requested later, will require a fresh discussion and agreement.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            Any disagreement or concern will first be handled through direct communication and mutual resolution. If unresolved,
            the matter shall fall under the jurisdiction of Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, India.
