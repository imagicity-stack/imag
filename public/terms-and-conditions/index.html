        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Definition</strong>
            <p>
              “We,” “us,” or “our” refers to IMAGICITY, its team members, and authorized representatives. “Client,” “you,” or
              “your” refers to any individual, company, or organization engaging with IMAGICITY or visiting its website. “Services”
              refers to all creative, strategic, digital, and marketing solutions provided by IMAGICITY, whether online or offline.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scope of Services</strong>
            <p>IMAGICITY provides tailored services including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Brand strategy and identity design.</li>
              <li>Marketing and advertising campaigns.</li>
              <li>Web and UI/UX development.</li>
              <li>Content creation, social media strategy, and digital growth consulting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All project details, deliverables, costs, and timelines are outlined in specific proposals, quotations, or contracts
              shared with the client.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Acceptance of Work</strong>
            <p>Work begins only after the client formally approves the quotation or proposal and makes the required advance payment.</p>
            <p>
              By approving the project, the client confirms that they understand the deliverables, timelines, and associated terms.
              Any modifications or additional requirements beyond the approved scope may result in revised pricing and extended
              timelines.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Terms</strong>
            <p>Projects require a non-refundable advance before work commences.</p>
            <p>
              The remaining balance must be paid as per the milestone structure or before final delivery. Delayed payments may lead
              to suspension or termination of work, and IMAGICITY reserves the right to withhold deliverables until payment is
              complete.
            </p>
            <p>Any third-party costs (e.g., hosting, domain, ads, plugins) will be billed separately.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ownership &amp; Intellectual Property</strong>
            <p>
              All intellectual property created by IMAGICITY (concepts, designs, strategies, code, or written content) remains
              IMAGICITY’s property until full payment is received.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon final payment, ownership of approved deliverables transfers to the client, unless otherwise stated in the
              agreement. IMAGICITY retains the right to display completed work in its portfolio, website, and case studies unless
              explicitly restricted in writing by the client.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
            <p>
              Both parties agree to maintain confidentiality regarding all proprietary or sensitive information shared during the
              project. IMAGICITY will not disclose, sell, or share client data with third parties, except as required for project
              execution or legal compliance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Revisions and Approvals</strong>
            <p>Each project includes a specific number of revision rounds as mentioned in the quotation.</p>
            <p>Additional revisions outside the agreed scope may incur extra charges.</p>
            <p>Final approval from the client closes the project; post-approval changes are treated as new work.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancellation Policy</strong>
            <p>Clients may request project cancellation before execution begins. Refunds, if applicable, will be handled as per our Return &amp; Refund Policy.</p>
            <p>
              IMAGICITY reserves the right to cancel or postpone a project in case of non-cooperation, delayed responses, or unethical
              conduct.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
